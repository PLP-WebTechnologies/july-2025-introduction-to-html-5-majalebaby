      <h2>What Is a Partnership?</h2>
      <p>A partnership is a business structure in which two or more individuals share ownership. For tax purposes, partnerships are generally <strong>pass-through entities</strong>, meaning income and losses pass through to the partners for individual reporting.</p>

      <h2>Tax Treatment of Partnerships</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Income Allocation</h3>
        <p>Partners are taxed on their share of the partnership's income, regardless of whether profits are distributed. The allocation is typically defined in the partnership agreement.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Deductions and Losses</h3>
        <p>Losses can offset other income on the partner’s individual return, subject to basis and at-risk limitations. Proper tracking of each partner’s capital account is essential.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Filing Requirements</h3>
        <p>The partnership itself files an informational return (e.g., IRS Form 1065 in the U.S.), and provides each partner with a schedule showing their share (e.g., Schedule K-1).</p>

Headings are in logical order (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>), images include descriptive <code>alt</code> text, and navigation uses an <code>aria-label</code> for clarity. Content is written to be human-readable while supplying structured signals (title, meta description, keywords) for discoverability.</p>
